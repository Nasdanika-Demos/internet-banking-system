The the above diagram is a [Code diagram](https://c4model.com/#CodeDiagram), which is used to show how a component is implemented as code.
Diagram elements were taken from the Drawio UML shapes palette.
Icons were added by manually adding ``image=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Nasdanika-Models/ecore@master/graph/web-resources/icons/EClass.gif;`` to the style.

There is one documented element on the diagram - [MainframeBankingSystemFacadeImpl](MainframeBankingSystemFacadeImpl/index.html).
